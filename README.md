About this project
Hey guys !

This is my custom automatic league of legends pick&ban overlay.
It works in all game modes including as a spectator.

To run it either build the project yourself and run the LWOServer project OR just download publish.rar and run the LWOServer.exe !

The overlay itself is reachable after starting under
http://localhost:9345/lol_picksandbans/overlay.html
The live admin interface where you can update scores, roles etc is under
http://localhost:9345/lol_picksandbans/admin.html

This build is updated and good to go.
Latest Patch 11.9
